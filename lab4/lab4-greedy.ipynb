        "The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) where a fleet of vehicles $K$ is available to serve a set of customers. Each vehicle has a limited capacity and the goal is to find a set of routes that minimizes the total travel cost while serving all customers and respecting the capacity constraint of each vehicle.\n",
        "\n",
        "In particulat, let $G = (V, A)$ be a complete graph, where $V = \\{0,...,n\\}$ is the vertex set and $A$ is the arc set. Vertices $i = 1,...,n$ correspond to the customers, whereas vertex $0$ corresponds to the depot. A nonnegative cost, $c_{ij}$, is associated with each arc $(i,j) \\in A$ and represents the travel cost spent to go from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$. We suppose that $c_{ii} = \\infty$ for all $i \\in V$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each customer $i \\in V$ is associated with a known nonnegative demand to be delivered, $d_i$, and the depot has a fictitious demand $d_0 = 0$. \n",
        "\n",
        "A set $K$ of identical vehicles, each with capacity $C$, is available at the depot. To ensure feasibility we assume that $d_i \\le C$ for each $i \\in V$ and that we have a sufficient amount of vehicles to serve all customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a vertex set $S \\subseteq V \\setminus \\{0\\}$, let $d(S) = \\sum_{i \\in S}{d_i}$ denote the total demand of the set. We denote with $r(S)$ the minimum number of vehicles needed to serve the total demand of $S$, i.e., $r(S) = \\lceil d(S)/C \\rceil$.\n",
        "\n",
        "The CVRP consists of finding a collection of vehicle routes with minimum cost, defined as the sum of the costs of the arcs belonging to each route, and such that:\n",
        "* each route starts and finishes at the depot vertex;\n",
        "* each customer vertex is visited by exactly one route; \n",
        "* the sum of the demands of the vertices visited by a route does not exceed the vehicle's capacity $C$.\n",

        "    2. Repeat while you have unrouted customers and the route $R$'s last node is not the depot:\n",
        "        1. Select the unrouted node (or depot) $i$ that is closest to the last node $j$ in the route\n",
        "        2. If $d_i + d(R) \\le C$ then add $i$ to the route"
